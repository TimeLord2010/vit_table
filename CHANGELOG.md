## 1.0.5

* FIX: table crashing when the widget is inside a container with finite height
and `enableHorizontalScroll` is set to true.

## 1.0.4

* FIX: table now behaves correctly when used in container with non infinite
height.

## 1.0.3

* FIX: handled the case where the available horizontal space is exactly 1

the widget would crash.

## 1.0.1

* FIX: imports in the default import (vit_table.dart).

## 1.0.0
